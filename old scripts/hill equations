In an attempt to better understand the dose responses, the data were also fitted to a modified
Hill equation: I = I max × D n /(IC 50 * n + D n ). In this equation, the relative inhibition (I) is expressed
as a function of drug concentration (D) determined by three parameters: I max , IC 50 * and n. I max
is the maximal retestdata[] <- round(testdata[], digits = 3)lative inhibition a drug can achieve at saturating concentration, IC 50 * is the drug
concentration that achieves half of maximal inhibition, and n is the Hill coefficient, or slope. We did
not use the fourth paramis I = [D]/([D] + IC 50 )eter of the full Hill equation, I 0 (inhibition in the absence of an inhibitor),
because there is no inhibition at the drug concentration of zero. Fitting the data into the above equation
produced the graphs shown in Figure S1.

At the center of targeted cancer, drug discovery is the analysis of how cancer cells respond to
treatment by various drugs. Historically, the analysis of how cancer cells respond to treatments has
used various versions of the Hill equation [10], which was originally developed to describe how O 2
binds to hemoglobin [11]. When applied to cell responses to drug treatment, the full Hill equation

(I = I max × D n /(IC 50 * n + D n )) uses three parameters to describe the response of biological systems to pharmaceutical intervention: I max (maximal inhibition at saturating drug concentration), n (Hill co-efficient), and IC 50 *, the concentration of a drug that achieves 50% of the I max [12].
When applied to how colorectal cancer cells responded to kinase inhibitors [12], the Hill co-efficient,
n, varied between 0.3 and 0.8 suggesting varying levels of negative cooperativity. However, there
is no obvious mechanistic explanation for this negative cooperativity. Furthermore, in some cases,
the dose response curves were clearly broken into two phases, suggesting that a targeted drug may
inhibit cell viability by interacting with two distinct targets with different affinities. Based on these
considerations, we developed a biphasic mathematical model for characterizing the cell responses to
targeted therapy [12]. The biphasic model assumes two inhibitory effects, and breaks the inhibition of a
cancer cell by a targeted drug into a target-specific inhibition (F 1 with K d1 ) and an off-target inhibition
(F 2 with K d2 ). In this model, the inhibition of cell viability by a drug as a function of drug concentration
(D) follows this equation: I = F 1 × [D]/([D] + K d1 ) + F 2 × [D]/([D] + K d2 ). We further demonstrated
that the biphasic inhibition only applies to multi-driver cancer cells, and toward mono-driver cancer
cells, the inhibition becomes monophasic, with F 2 inhibition becoming negligible. Thus, the biphasic
model was able to distinguish multi-driver from mono-driver cancer cells. Furthermore, by identifying
inhibitors for each driver, and quantifying the amplitude (F 1 ) and the potency (K d1 ) of the inhibition
by blocking each driver, the biphasic analysis was able to suggest potent and synergistic combinations
for blocking colorectal cancer cells [12].
